                            “Corazón is a medical technology startup that builds an implantable heart health monitoring device” (ACM Ethics, 2021) which means it will be looked at a with a greater deal of scrutiny as section 1a of the BCS code of conduct states to have “regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others” (BCS, 2022) which means Corazón will have an “obligation to the public at large, including for the public’s health” (Tavani, 2016). This means that the technology used needs to ensure that its claims of regulating heart health need to be accurate and that the data it collects is protected as they have “employed standard cryptographic algorithms, and all data stored locally on the phone was encrypted” (ACM Ethics, 2021). This is a good step as the user can then share the data themselves and isn’t stored with Corazón which can help prevent against a data leak if they were to succumb to one. They also follow principle 3.7 to commit to security and improvement meaning they do not get comfortable with where they are at and strive to try and protect their users data (ACM Ethics, 2021). There are risks involved however as Corazón being one of the only companies in this space can lead to complacency in improvement.
