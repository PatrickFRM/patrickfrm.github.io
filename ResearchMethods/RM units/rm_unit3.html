                        <h3>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The method that resonated with me most was mixed methods research as discussed by (Hirose & Creswell, 2022) as they specify “the six criteria are a rationale for mixed methods; quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods questions; separate quantitative and qualitative data; a mixed method design and a diagram; integration in a joint display; and meta inferences”. Using multiple of these approaches but specifically using both qualitative and quantitative research methods as a basis is a good way to move forward as it allows the collection of data supported by literature and firsthand accounts through interviews.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</h3>
                        <p>
                            For data collection I will be using surveys and questionnaires in order to collect quantitative data as broken down by Fleetwood from QuestionPro (Fleetwood, 2024). This is due to their ability to be quickly distributed and easily accessible when collecting data, however the preparation involved needs to be carefully conducted as a suitable sample size needs to be determined and other studies need to be reviewed so previous works can be built upon. (Fleetwood, 2024). To collect qualitative data the use of focus groups and interviews are a great way of speaking with people about their experiences as they can offer a range of diverse viewpoints (Dawson, 2015).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This will require a range of skills such as interview and communication skills which Dawson emphasised when conducting things such as focus groups as you need to be able to talk to different people from different backgrounds (Dawson, 2015). Analytical skills will also be important to understanding all of the data collected from both TfL and questionnaires.
