                        <h3><strong>Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of information</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.
                            Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Ethical Concerns</strong></h3>
                        <p><strong>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Abi should not analyse “correct data” as it would be unethical as this would be falsified data which can mislead consumers as statisticians should not mislead consumers by trying to obtain a predetermined outcome as they would be manipulating data to assist Whizzz and harm consumers. (Rosnow & Rosenthal, 2013)
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Abi is obligated to provide both positive and negative analyses as Whizzz should be made aware because Whizzz can go off the impression that nothing is wrong with their cereal and promote it positively when there is negative analysis that they were not made aware of. This can leave the company Abi’s institute liable and at least if they inform Whizzz it is then allowing Whizzz to make a call on how they want to move forward as they now know the positive and negative analysis as it is the most transparent. (Rosnow & Rosenthal, 2013)
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Abi is responsible for the results that they have produced and should ensure that they are used correctly, and the misuse of their data should be prevented. (ASA, 2022)
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Abi should do their best effort to put all results forwards and ensure that the negative results are not buried beneath the positive results. This would ensure that their results are highlighted and made clear. They should also stress to the manufacture the harm of only publishing the positive data. They should also consider peer review to ensure that they are accurate.
