                        <p>
                            In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

                        <p>
                            Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

                        <h3>Answer</h3>
                        <p>
                            Google’s project “Project Nightingale” where they partnered with a US healthcare system called “Ascension” and the goal was to collect and analyse personal health data, but it was done without consent of the patients it was being collected from. This was done through surveys and more than 50 million American patients did not give consent (Pilkington, 2019). This is a big reach from Google by not requesting consent from the patients and that the data had not been anonymised to protect patients which is an oversight by Google as this would need to be done even if the patients gave consent. This was because Ascension didn’t anonymise before passing the data to Google (Schneble et al., 2020). However, despite the data sharing not being done ethically it was not done with patient consent as Ascension gave Google full unchecked access to this data (Schneble et al., 2020). In future patients should be given informed consent to avoid any sort of privacy violations so that trust can be kept as data collecting companies such as Google can have distrust grown against them.
